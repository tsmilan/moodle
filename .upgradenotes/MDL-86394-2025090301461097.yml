issueNumber: MDL-86394
notes:
  core_grades:
    - message: |
        Added a new hook to allow plugins to perform actions after a grade
        category aggregation is calculated.
        It can be used to compute alternate totals (e.g. preview a course total
        without grade penalties) without mutating core database records.
      type: improved
    - message: >
        Extended update_raw_grade() to accept $deductedmark, so penalised grade
        and deducted mark are written together. Ensures the hook always receive
        consistent data.
      type: changed
    - message: |
        Deprecated update_deducted_mark(), which is no longer used in core.
      type: deprecated
